    ### Welcome to the Emotion Recognition Survey!
    
    #### Please read the following instructions carefully!

    You will be shown a series of images and videos of athletes, each for 2 seconds, after which you have to answer 2 simple questions:
    """)

    st.info("""
    1. What emotions are being shown by the athlete you just saw? You have to select the **appropriate emotions** from the given options:

            Angry, Happy, Sad, Scared, Surprised, Disgusted, Contempt/Hate/Disdain, and Neutral.
    """)
    
    st.info("""
    2. Did the athlete **win or lose** the match/contest?
    """)

    st.markdown("""        
    For each clip in the survey, please indicate whether the athlete won or lost, and rate the emotions you observe. 
    
    **You can pick multiple emotions (as many as you need). Each emotion is rated independently on a 0 to 100 scale. Each of these emotions has to be rated separately, they do not need to add up to 100.**
    """)
    
    st.warning("""
    **Neutral emotion is used when you do not see any specific emotion on the athlete. **
    It can be used with other emotions but cannot be 100. 
    E.g. Surprised 30, Sad 20 and Neutral **20** is accepted, but Surprised 30 and Neutral 100 is not accepted. 
    **WHILE NEUTRAL CAN BE COMBINED WITH OTHER EMOTIONS, DO NOT SELECT NEUTRAL 100 IF OTHER EMOTIONS ARE PRESENT**
    
    Thus, Neutral would be 0 if other emotions are present, and 100 if no other emotions are visible or present according to you. Any score in between can be combined with other emotions.

    Now, if you have understood these instructions, proceed to the **3 practice clips, followed by a message, after which your survey will begin.**
